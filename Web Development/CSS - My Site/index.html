        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="middle-container-bio">
          Recent graduate with a B.S in Computer Science aiming to leverage my
          fundamental knowledge of programming and software to have a successful
          career as a Software Engineer. I am an out-of-the-box thinker who
          loves tackling problems that others tend not to. I am a fast learner
          with a strong work ethic that is looking to drive product success and
          efficiency. Frequently praised as detail-orientated among my peers, I
          can be relied upon to complete projects promptly.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started coding when I was 13 years old, wanting to create video
            games. I pursued my interest to college to learn how to become a
            Software Engineer and build extensive and elaborate applications. I
            developed an expertise in backend development, while adapting to
            other fields in programming around me such as web development, data
            analysis, etc.

          <h3>Professional Gamer</h3>
          <p>
            I believe I am a awesome gamer who can't be stopped! No matter what
            genere of video game, I tend to adapt and improve myself over time
            to conquer stages and other players.
